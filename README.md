# **Restaurant Management System with QR Code Ordering**


## **Project Description**

*This project is a comprehensive restaurant management system designed to streamline operations and enhance customer experience by leveraging QR code technology. Customers can scan a QR code placed on their table to access a digital menu directly on their mobile devices. This contactless ordering process not only increases convenience but also minimizes physical interactions, ensuring a safer dining experience. Once an order is placed, real-time updates keep both the customer and the restaurant staff informed about the status of the order—from preparation to delivery. The system is built to facilitate efficient order management, reduce wait times, and improve overall operational workflow in a modern restaurant environment.*
